# QWRT Media

QWRT Media is currently under construction as we build a new home for music discovery.  
We're creating an online magazine and an artist-first radio station designed to spotlight independent musicians and connect curious listeners with fresh new sounds.

## What This Repo Is For
This repository will hold the source code, design assets, and documentation behind the QWRT Media website and its related features.

As development progresses, you'll find:
- The magazine layout and article system
- Radio integrations (including AzuraCast player + metadata)
- Visual design, branding, and components
- Backend structure for publishing and streaming

## Mission
Support independent artists through transparent storytelling, thoughtful curation, and accessible, community-driven broadcasting.

## Status
🚧 **Active development — site not yet live**  
Features and structure will be added as the project grows.
